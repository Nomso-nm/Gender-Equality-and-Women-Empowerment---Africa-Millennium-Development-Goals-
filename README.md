# Gender Equality and Women Empowerment - Africa Millennium Development Goals 

**Introduction**

This an analysis of the Africa Millennium Development goals (AMDG) aimed at identifying the level of progress towards gender equality in education and opportunities in Africa. Despite being the poorest continent, there are still various evidence of inequality. The insights from this exploration will help illuminate the progress and challenges faced by these countries. It will uncover information that can be used in the future to guide policy development, resource allocation, and advocacy efforts.

**Key Questions**

The analysis is guided by five key questions:

•	What is the historical trend in the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women in Africa?
•	Which country has seen the greatest increase?
•	How does the ratio of girls to boys in primary, secondary, and tertiary education compare across countries?
•	Which country has the greatest parity difference?
•	Is there a correlation between the ratios of girls to boys in higher education and the proportion of women in non-agricultural wage employment?

**Method of Analysis**

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle in a csv format. Using Microsoft excel, the data was thoroughly inspected for errors and missing data. Then it was uploaded on DBeaver where effective SQL data manipulation and analysis was carried out. 

**Insights** 

1.	The line chart shows a trend of the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women in Africa over time, from 1990 onwards. There is a clear overall upward trend in the proportion of seats held by women in parliaments across Africa. This suggests that there has been progress towards gender equality in political representation. The most significant growth appears to have occurred after the year 2000, with the proportion of seats held by women rising more steeply from this point on. 

2.	Rwanda stands out with the greatest increase in parliamentary representation significantly higher than any other country. 


3.	Uganda stands out with the highest ratio in tertiary education compared to other countries, indicating a higher proportion of girls compared to boys at this education level. The ratio in primary education tends to be lower than in secondary education, which may suggest that as education level increases, the gender gap narrows.

4.	Morocco has the greatest parity difference.

5.	From the available dataset, there is a weak correlation between between the ratios of girls to boys in tertiary education and proportion of women in non-agricultural wage employment ratio. 

**Conclusion** 

The analyses highlight both progress and ongoing challenges in gender equality across different sectors in Africa. While there has been significant advancement in political representation and educational attainment for women, these gains do not always correlate directly with improved economic opportunities in non-agricultural sectors. This underscores the complexity of gender equality issues, which require multifaceted strategies, adequate data and sustained efforts across education, economic participation, and political empowerment to achieve comprehensive progress.

**Ackowledgement** 

Sincere gratitude to Wendyellé A. Alban Nyantudre for making this analysis possible the use of the "Africa Millennium Development Goals - MDG" dataset, that he provided on Kaggle. This dataset covers a wide array of indicators crucial for understanding the progress of various African nations towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The comprehensive nature of this dataset has provided invaluable insights into sectors such as education, gender equality, health, and economic development across numerous countries including Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, and many others.
